        <p className="text-base">During my graduation, I landed an internship at <b className="text-white">Persistent</b>, where I dove into React and JavaScript, building my first project: <b className="text-white">an expense tracker.</b></p> 
        <p className="text-base">That experience sparked my passion for creating interactive and efficient web applications. Later, I received an offer from <b className="text-white">Quantiphi</b>, where I had the chance to work on a range of projects, from <b className="text-white">front-end to back-end</b>, building my expertise across various technologies.</p> 
        <p className="text-base">In my free time, I love experimenting with new app ideas, bridging front-end aesthetics with robust back-end functionality.</p>
